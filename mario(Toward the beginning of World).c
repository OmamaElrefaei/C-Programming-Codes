//Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over adjacent pyramids of blocks, per the below.
//In this program I allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.
